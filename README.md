# LiveShare
 
Please remember to make new js, css and html files in the respective folders for each LiveShare task.
If you don't remember this, it's going to be looking like a huge mess! D:

Images can be stored in the img folder in the root directory, but also in the respective folder for each LiveShare tasks.

The complete rework of folder structure etc is not completely done, but it's mostly done and ready to use.
